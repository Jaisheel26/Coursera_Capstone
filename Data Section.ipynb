The data also include the information about the places around each neighborhood like restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, parks, theaters, art galleries, museums and many more. We selected one Borough from each city to analyze their neighborhoods. Manhattan from New York and Downtown Toronto from Toronto. We will use machine learning technique, \u201cClustering\u201d to segment the neighborhoods with similar objects on the basis of each neighborhood data. These objects will be given priority on the basis of foot traffic (activity) in their respective neighborhoods. This will help to locate the tourist\u2019s areas and hubs, and then we can judge the similarity or dissimilarity between two cities on that basis.\n\npath='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**METHODOLOGY**"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "As we have selected two cities Borough to explore their neighborhoods.

In the arrangement phase, which applied multiple steps including but not limited to, eliminating \u201cNot assigned\u201d values, combine neighborhoods which have same geographical coordinates at each borough and sorted against the concerned borough. For data verification and further exploration, we use Foursquare API to get the coordinates of Downtown Toronto and explore its neighborhoods. The neighborhoods are further characterized as venues and venue categories. For Manhattan, we used a saved data file which is already explored through foursquare API in which we have extracted all the boroughs of New York and then sorted against the concerned borough. Then we explored the Manhattan neighborhoods as venues and venue categories\n\n"}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
